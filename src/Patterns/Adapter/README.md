In this example, a 404:Not Found error is being generated. You are going to assume that the error message
content and code may change, but the text will always stay in the same format

=================
UPDATE 2:
The package the admin chose requires the errors to be logged to a multicolumn CSV file.
The CSV format calls for the first column to be the numeric error code. The second column should be the error text.
